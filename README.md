# Country Hook
This project demonstrates the use of React hooks for fetching and displaying country data from an API. It features a custom hook that retrieves a list of countries and displays them in a user-friendly interface. The goal is to showcase how React's hooks can be used to manage state and side effects effectively, with a focus on clean and reusable code.
